      "   One of the strengths of SQLite is that, once a database is stored,\n",
      "   it is much faster when we have to make frequent queries.\n",
      "   In this problem, we will test the question, \"how fast is SQLite really?\",\n",
      "   by measuring the CPU time to\n",
      "   - use pure Python to brute-force search a CSV file,\n",
      "   - create an SQLite database by reading in a CSV file, and\n",
      "   - query an existing SQLite database.\n",
      "\n",
      "For simplicity, we will extract only two columns: `month` (the 2nd colum) and `cancelled` (the 24th column).\n",
      "\n",
      "(Note: The `cancelled` column is actually the 22nd column,\n",
      "  and the 24th column is `diverted`. This bug was discovered too late,\n",
      "  so in the following simply pretend that the 24th column is `cancelled`,\n",
      "  but keep in mind that we are actually counting the number of diverted flights.)"
