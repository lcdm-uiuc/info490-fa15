## Introduction to Data Analysis in Python ##

In this week, you will begin to use Python to work with data. First, you will learn about the Pandas library, which can greatly simplify working with large, structured data sets (Pandas introduces many concepts from the R language into Python). You will learn about the Pandas DataFrame object and how to use it to select, group, and filter data. Finally, you will learn about basic statistical measurements, theoretical data distributions, and how to use them in Python programs.

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand how to use the Pandas library to read and write structured data into a Python program.
- Understand how to use a Pandas DataFrame to select, group, and filter data.
- Understand summary statistics
- Understand several basic data distributions and how to sample from these distributions by using Python functions.
