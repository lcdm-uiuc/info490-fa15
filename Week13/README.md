## Machine Learning ##

In this week, you will learn about basic machine learning concepts, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, dimensional reduction, and cluster finding. We will use the sickout_learn library to perform these tasks, specifically introducing the KNN, SVM, decision trees, and random forest classification algorithms, the PCA dimensional reduction algorithm, and the k-means cluster finding algorithm. 

### Objectives ###

#####By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######

- Understand the basic principles about machine learning.
- Understand how to perform supervised learning to classify data.
- Understand how rot perform dimensional reduction by using PCA.
- Understand how to perform cluster finding by using k-means.
